    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "(Janeway 9th edition CH13-13)\nEvery 2-3 years a variant flu virus arises with mutations that allow it to evade neutralization by the antibodies present in the population. Other mutations may affect epitopes in viral proteins that are recognized by T cells, particularly CD8 cytotoxic T cells, with the consequence that cells infected with the mutant virus also escape destruction. People immune to the old flu virus are thus susceptible to the new variant, but because the changes in the viral proteins are relatively minor, there is still some cross-reaction with antibodies and memory T cells produced against the previous variant, and most of the population still has some level of immunity. Thus, epidemics resulting from antigenic drift are typically mild。\n［出自考古第2題］"

    },
    "answer": "D",
    "explanation": "(Janeway 9th edition CH16-16)\nAnother form of adoptive immunotherapy also uses retroviruses to introduce genes into a patient's T cells, but involves expressing a novel type of receptor, known as a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy: CARs are fusion receptors that contain extracellular antigen-specific domains fused to intracellular domains that provide signals for activation and co-stimulation. These receptors are introduced into T cells via retroviral vectors to produce so-called CAR T cells. This approach differs from conventional adoptive T-cell therapies as the use of a CAR allows the T cell's target specificity to be almost any molecule recognizable by an antibody rather than just peptide:MHC complexes。\n［出自考古第4題］"
