      "B": "(B) Bcl-2 為 Survival factor,在Memory T cell 中表現較多,使細胞有較長的半生期;CD45RO 則在 Effector/memory T cell surface 表現量較多。",

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Based on the provided answer key (B) and the highly mismatched question/option numbering, it's assumed that answer (B) refers to option (B) description from page 13. While option (B) description is not a direct answer to 'reason for repeated immunization', it describes isotype switching and affinity maturation, which are consequences of repeated immunization. This is a highly speculative interpretation due to significant errors and mismatches in the original material. A more accurate answer to 'reason for repeated immunization' would be option D from page 6, or option D description from page 13 if interpreted differently.

      "B": "(B) 課本敘述有些病原體可以 Induce CD8 T-cell response without CD4 T-cell help, 但並非「所有病原體」。所以寫手認為題目敘述不佳,若改為「does not \"always\" need」較為正確。",

    "answer": ["B", "D"],
    "explanation": "Options (B) and (D) are correct statements regarding CD8 T cell activation. Some pathogens can induce CD8 T cell responses without CD4$^+$ T cell help, and TCR activation is crucial for CD8 T cell proliferation and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells. Options (A) and (C) are incorrect as bystander activation by cytokines alone does not equip CD8 T cells with cytotoxicity. [出自考古第3題 (actually Question 4 from page 6)]"

    "explanation": "The provided answer (AC) and its relation to question 5 of page 6 is highly problematic and likely incorrect. Option (A) description about tissue-homing markers is partially correct (CCR9 for small intestine, CCR10 for large intestine, $\alpha$4$\beta$7 for mucosal homing), but option (C) description about B cell frequency is completely unrelated to tissue homing and is likely misplaced. A more accurate answer for large intestine homing would be options B and D from page 6 (CCR10 and $\alpha$4$\beta$7).  The answer AC is unexplainable and inconsistent based on the provided options and question about large intestine homing. This question is severely flawed.
