    "question": "Concerning viral infections, which statement is CORRECT?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Since most viruses are intracellular infection and they are hijacking the machinery from the host cells to replicate, there is no medicine available to cure any viral infections.",
      "B": "The idea of Dr. Edward Jenner's vaccination and Chinese variolation to immunize people against smallpox is the same. They all used cowpox to induce immunity.",
      "C": "During viral infections, the first-line of host defense is usually mediated by TLR-induced cytokines like type I interferons which trigger antiviral state in cells.",
      "D": "During viral infections, adaptive immunity is more important than innate immunity as viruses are cleared only when adaptive immunity is initiated."
    },
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "選項C 正確。\n選項A 對於病毒感染，有抗病毒藥物 (anti-viral drug) 與殺病毒劑 (viricide) 可使用。前者是用於抑制體內的病毒，而後者是用於消滅體外的病毒。抗病毒藥物的機理主要是通過影響干擾病毒複製週期的某個環節來實現抵抗病毒的進一步感染。例如直接抑制或殺滅病毒、干擾病毒吸附、阻止病毒穿入細胞、抑制病毒生物合成、抑制病毒釋放或增強宿主抗病毒能力等。此選項說沒有藥物可用是錯誤的。\n選項B 前者是利用牛痘引起免疫反應；後者是採用天花病人的結痂和膿汁，接種到健康人的身上。讓人感染輕微的天花，輕微發病之後，即可獲得免疫力，之後便不會再犯天花。此選項說法牛痘與天花膿汁相同是錯誤的。\n選項D 先天免疫比後天免疫重要。雖然先天免疫無法完全消滅病原體，但可以將其控制在一定數量。若沒有先天免疫，則病原體會在體內大量滋生而導致個體死亡。此選項說法後天免疫比先天免疫重要是錯誤的。\n［出自考古第1題］"
